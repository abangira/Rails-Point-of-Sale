The models
Let’s review what we want this app to do:
Track multiple orders
 Track multiple sales
 Each having a collection of items
 Record clients
 Record suppliers
Track stock.....the store will have base stock
A payment has status—outstanding payments, fully paid
Roles can be assigned to users-salesman or manager
Users can get an easy view of the order they placed
